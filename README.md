pyHypnoLSD
==========

Python tools for interacting with the [HypnoLSD](http://hypnocube.com/product/led_serial_driver/) module by Hypnocube.com


Plan
----
* Simple, dumb TTY emulation to test the basic command mode commands
* HypnoLSD configuration basics
* Library for doing "draw mode" commands
* Convenience classes for common usage
* Code samples!


Thanks

Thanks goes out to Chris Lomont and Gene Foulk who have provided me with documentation, sample code, and most importantly, a prototype module while the final release version kept being pushed back due to stocking issues.
